The goal is to permanently protect the property from conversion to non-forest uses by placing a CE to extinguish the development rights and expand the existing no-cut buffers (currently 50’-90’, which follows state Forest Practices) to 150&#39; on the salmon-bearing streams and 100&#39; on the marine shoreline, permanently protecting the property’s working forest, environmental, and ecosystem benefits. Preventing development on the property eliminates the possibility of conversion to a non-forest uses, as well as anthropogenic damages to water quality (e.g., fecal coliform contamination, water temperature), salmon habitat, shoreline processes, and cultural resources associated with residential development.The property has been actively-managed as a working forest for over 150 years by Port Blakely Tree Farms, generating multiple rotations of timber and supplying local mills. However, the property has been zoned for rural residential development, and plans drawn up for its development. Conversion to a non-forest use would not only impact generations of local forest products, habitat, and cultural resources, but it would also be detrimental to the productive - and commercially lucrative - shellfish growing areas in the inlet. </div>')[0];

The project site is divided into two blocks. The northern block straddles the confluence of Rock Creek and East Fork Lewis River. The southern block straddles Rock Creek upstream from the confluence. The entirety of the project is Designated Forest Land and is actively managed for timber. It contains 174 acres of Tier 1 Forest Resource Land and 168.75 acres of Tier 2 Forest Resource Land. According to the 2016 Comprehensive Growth Management Plan for Clark County, these designations apply to those lands which have the physical characteristics that are capable of management for the long-term production of commercially significant forest products. Tier 1 is primarily applied to larger parcels and industrial forestry landowners. The Forest-80 base zone implements Tier 1 designation, while the Forest-20 base zone implements Tier 2 designation. However, the Tier 1 land on this project is already divided into 5-acre residential lots and Tier 2 lands are divided into 20-acre lots. Because these lots were created prior to current zoning regulations, they can be marketed for residential development. This project will prevent fragmentation and future development of the project site, ensuring that it continues to be managed as a working forest.</div>')[0];

The land trust will buy a voluntary land preservation agreement, also called a conservation easement, which will prevent development of the land and ensure the farm remains available for agricultural production. The land has been farmed by the family since 1933, and the third, fourth, and fifth generations are active on the farm today. This farm contains all prime and prime, if irrigated, farmland soils, and is planted with spinach and cauliflower seed crop, barley, corn, and fruit tree-fescue grass mix. The farm and other land that the Smith family leases and owns in the area, provide all the feed for their cattle and are an integral part of their dairy operation. The farm is in eastern Clallam County, which is primarily large tracts of farmland, wetlands, and wildlife habitat. This farm is a popular birding spot and is popular with the Dungeness herd of elk. This project is the first of phase of a conservation vision to conserve all of the land that the family farms, including its 115-acre dairy.

This project was specifically listed in the 2006 Colockum Wildlife Area Management Plan. The goals of the project were to reduce the density of Douglas Fir and Grand Fir by removing trees that had invaded as a result of past logging practices and wild fire suppression, open up Ponderosa Pine stands using different tree spacing requirements and burn the resulting slash to reduce fuels and improve regeneration of fire-dependent plant species for deer and elk browse. The harvest portion of this project was completed leaving well-spaced stands of large Ponderosa Pines. Harvest slash was not piled, but instead left fairly evenly distributed on the landscape. The prescribed fire portion of the project was not completed. After 10 years abundant fuels remain and now we are seeing natural regeneration of conifer seedlings between the large leave trees. We propose to complete the original project and use manual labor and prescribed fire to reduce fuel loading, stimulate fire-dependent plant species and move the stand towards a condition that a more natural fire return interval would create. Planning, site preparation and implementation would likely span a two-year period.</div>')[0];

The County will upgrade the west end of the Spruce Railroad Trail from a 3-foot-wide natural surface trail to a 13- to 14-foot-wide path for non-motorized uses and accessible by people with disabilities. This is the fourth of a five-phase, multi-year reconstruction effort of the 36-mile-long former railroad. The U.S. Army Signal Corps built the Spruce Production Division Railroad in 1918 along the north side of Lake Crescent in Clallam County for transporting spruce logs used to manufacture World War I biplanes. The Daley-Rankin Tunnel is the shorter of two railroad tunnels along the lake. The longer McFee Tunnel is being restored with another Wildlife and Recreation Program grant. Completion of all phases of this project will provide a safe alternative to the 12-mile-long Lake Crescent corridor for bicyclists, pedestrians, horse riders, and wheelchair users. The busy U.S. Highway 101 doesn’t have safe shoulders and forces trail users to travel on the highway. Clallam County will contribute $651,000 in cash and donations of cash and labor.</div>')[0];

Development will include the construction of the sprayground facility along with the remodel of an existing park restroom/utility building to support the sprayground. The project will also include construction of a covered picnic shelter, accessible walkways and accessible parking. Other elements include perimeter seating, utility relocation, irrigation and landscaping modifications and park furnishings.  The primary recreation opportunity provided by the project will be active aquatic and local park outdoor recreation. The project has two goals: (1) relieve over-usage of the city&#39;s Heritage Park Fountain, which was not designed to accommodate the amount of use it receives on hot summer days; and (2) distribute this usage by constructing the first of several convenient, &#34;neighborhood scale&#34; spraygrounds across the city.

RR Reach Floodplain Restoration    WWRP Funding: $1,530,000    Desc.: This restoration project will restore salmon habitat forming processes to approximately 15.5 acres of floodplain, numerous side channels, and 2,000 feet of the Dungeness River. This will be accomplished by removing the environmentally harmful 585-foot long RR Trestle and its associated fill from the floodplain at River Mile 5.8 near Sequim. The Trestle, which supports the Olympic Discovery Trail (ODT), is built on 36 creosoted piling bents (5 piling each) placed on 16-foot centers. The 16-foot openings, along with the floodplain fill, have proven to severely restrict floodplain processes and have constrained the river channel to a single location (the 150-foot opening at the RR Bridge) for more than 60 years. Upstream of the Trestle the river meanders significantly, but meanders have been unable to move through the Trestle, causing channel instability and harm to salmon habitat. Negatively impacted species include 4 ESA-listed salmon and char: Puget Sound Chinook and steelhead, Eastern Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum and bull trout, along with fall chum, Coho, and pink salmon. Flooding in early 2015 swept away one of the Trestle&#39;s piling bents, allowing the river to migrate, and the main river channel now runs beneath the Trestle. With the Trestle damaged and the ODT temporarily closed, the time is right to restore floodplain functions by replacing the habitat-unfriendly creosoted industrial infrastructure with a 750-foot, CMZ-spanning, river-friendly pedestrian bridge built on 4 piers. </div>')[0];

These sites are located in Pacific and Grays Harbor Counties. These Natural Areas include rare salt marsh habitats and extensive forested uplands, including significant pockets of mature and old-growth forest. These Natural Areas represent a large portion of a quickly disappearing mature/old-growth forest landscape in Southwest Washington.Restoration will focus primarily on the thinning of densely planted commercial forest stands post 1960. In their current condition, these forests provide little habitat for diverse plant and animal communities and are not representative of a natural coastal forest ecosystem. Goals for the restoration include reducing stand density, increasing understory vegetation and plant diversity, increasing the amount of large woody debris on the forest floor, and creating wildlife snags. Doing so will dramatically improve the quality of habitat for a variety of plant and animal species, including the marbled murelet, spotted owl, populations of cavity dwelling bird species, amphibians, and the resident herds of Roosevelt Elk.</div>')[0];

The goal of this project is to permanently protect priority habitat for two federally listed species, Chinook salmon and steelhead trout that are threatened by timber harvest and real-estate conversion. The Busy Wild Creek acquisitions target the headwaters of the Mashel River, located one mile north of Ashford, Washington, and three miles west of the main entrance to Mount Rainier National Park. The subject property includes 1,920 acres of timberlands with both banks of 2.41 miles of upper Busy Wild Creek and 12.92 miles of feeder streams.  It has been managed as industrial timberland since the 1940s and will be acquired to remove the immediate threat of further timber harvest and stream siltation. The Busy Wild sub-basin is identified as a high priority in the Nisqually Chinook Recovery Plan and a highest priority in the Nisqually Steelhead Recovery Plan.The Middle Mashel acquisitions, located near Eatonville, target 313 acres of riparian habitat and 60 acres of forested upland with 2.49 salmon-producing river miles and 2.29 tributary miles. Should circumstances prevent successful acquisition of the priority target property in Mashel Middle Reach 1, or should funding allow, the Nisqually Land Trust proposes to acquire, in fee simple, 1.22 salmon-producing river miles, 1.65 tributary miles, 181 acres of riparian habitat and 139 acres of forested uplands in Mashel Middle Reach 2. The Nisqually Chinook Salmon Recovery Plan ranks protection and restoration of the Mashel River basin a Tier 1 priority, just after the Nisqually estuary and mainstem. Within the Mashel basin, the Nisqually Steelhead Recovery Plan ranks Mashel River Middle Reach 1 and Middle Reach 2 as highest priorities for restoration and protection. All of the Mashel has been designated as federal critical habitat for steelhead trout.The Mashel River is the largest tributary to the Nisqually River. The target properties have steep, unstable slopes and are included within larger ownerships of industrial forestland. Acquisition would prevent further habitat degradation; connect two substantial blocks of Mashel shoreline protected in earlier phases of the Mashel Shoreline Protection Initiative, creating a nearly continuous protected river corridor of some 5.7 miles; and provide for future riparian habitat and in-stream restoration. Acquisition would also extend and buffer federal, state, and local protected habitat for threatened northern spotted owls and marbled murrelets; provide for expansion of the Mashel Greenbelt Trail; and protect a key section of the popular Mount Tahoma Trails public cross-country ski trail.</div>')[0];

Located from the head of Miller Bay to the lower reaches of Grovers Creek, 1.1 miles upstream, the project will protect forested uplands, main-stem and tributary creek reaches, side channel refugia, a diverse riparian wetland complex, and a salt water bay.  The wetland complex contributes to the habitat quality of the bay through sediment storage, non-point pollution filtration, flood attenuation, and slow release of water to maintain healthy spawning and rearing refugia habitat for ESA listed winter steelhead, coho, fall/winter chum, and cutthroat. The property also includes aquatic and terrestrial linked habitat for amphibians and nesting and foraging area for neo-tropical migratory birds. The project would allow Kitsap County to hold a property interest (e.g. easement or right-of-way deed) for future development and public use of a non-motorized trail and/or shared-use pathway providing a link to a regional trail system connecting Kingston to the Hood Canal Bridge near Port Gamble. Any trail and/or pathway will be aligned in the future to make the shortest and least environmentally disruptive connection across the project site, linking isolated upland areas and minimizing impacts to wetlands and wildlife, as further described in the Special Conditions to this Agreement.</div>')[0];

Additional elements include: filling of irrigation ditches to restore ground water flow to freshwater ponds and wetlands; removal of two culverts; and riparian, wetland, and upland re-vegetation. The project area covers approximately 45 acres within Secret Harbor. Cypress Island supports communities of marbled murrelet, Pacific salmon, crabs, marine birds, and bald eagles.

Protecting Kiket from development will benefit diverse nearshore habitat including feeder bluffs, kelp and eelgrass that support Chinook, chum, and coho salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Herring, surf smelt, and sand lance spawn along the Kiket Island shore. A rare and high functioning pocket estuary fed by freshwater seeps through a palustrine scrub shrub wetland  is adjacent to and largely surrounded by the acquisition property and offers important habitat to juvenile salmonids, forage fish, and numerous waterfowl and shorebirds.

The property also provides access to the West Branch Little Spokane River, Horseshoe Lake, and Fan Lake.  </div>')[0];

Bellevue is bounded on the west by Lake Washington and on the east by Lake Sammamish. However, because of urban development, topography and the almost continuous private ownership of the shoreline, the public has limited visual and physical access to these lakes. Of the more than 11 miles of shoreline along the two lakes, less than 10 percent is publicly owned. Bellevue has made a substantial commitment in the past decade to increase the public presence along the waterfront, especially on Lake Washington. Nine parcels have been acquired between Meydenbauer Beach Park and the marina since 1993. Acquiring this parcel adds .32 acre to the city&#39;s holdings and leaves only one parcel left to complete the Lake Washington acquisition plan envisioned in the mid-1970s. This property is critical to the city&#39;s long-range vision for the area, which includes a regionally significant waterfront park that extends from Meydenbauer Beach Park to the marina, and a connection from that park to Bellevue&#39;s downtown. </div>')[0];

The Mt. St. Helens State Wildlife Area was established here in 1990 for elk winter range and also provides habitat for federally threatened steelhead and Coho salmon.  In 1996-97 several hundred acres of productive elk winter range was lost and river avulsions into tributary streams destroyed high quality salmonid spawning and rearing habitat.  The purpose of the project is to place logjams and plant vegetation to enhance and prevent future losses of both upland and riparian/instream habitat.  Wood will have to be trucked to the site and will be anchored by buring key logs or using on-site boulders as ballast. This work will occur in about 20 acres over a three-mile area and serves to protect and enhance hundreds of acres of valuable uplands and several miles of productive fish bearing streams.Actions prior to WDFW acquisition have contributed to erosion and associated habitat losses.  Recruitment of large wood is absent due to salvage logging that occurred after the eruption.  Intensively managed commercial forestlands, impacted by the volcanic blast, surround the wildlife area.  Canopy closure in these extensive even-aged stands has substantially reduced elk forage in a wide area.  Forage loss due to erosion and watershed scale forest maturation has contributed to reduced carrying capacity and elk winter mortality.  There is widespread public support for protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat in this area.</div>')[0];

Water Play Area   WWRP Funding: $300,000    Desc.: The scope of this project is to construct an approximate 35,000 square foot accessible water play area at Crossroads Community Park in Bellevue.  This will be the first playground in Bellevue specifically designed to accommodate the needs of the physically impaired, and the first to incorporate water as a significant play element.  Interactive play features will provide for all levels of physical abilities, and designed to promote an appreciation of the different cultures represented in the area.Crossroads Community Park is ideally suited for this project.  The water play area is an integral part of the adopted park Master Plan, which reflects the international flavor of the area. The neighborhood is the most ethnically diverse and economically challenged in Bellevue.  35% of its 10,000 residents are foreign-born and nearly 60% are at low to moderate income levels.  The park includes family gathering places and accessible restrooms adjacent to the project site, and is home to the Kindering Center, which serves children with developmental disabilities.The project is a partnership between the City of Bellevue and the Bellevue Breakfast Rotary Club.  The Rotary Club has committed to a major fundraising effort to construct this facility, and has raised $100,000 to date.  The City has committed over $110,000 in local funds, has received two grants totaling $89,600, and received a $250,000 State CTED appropriation for this project.</div>')[0];

Restoration work will include expanding the prairie by removing invasive species and trees. Native prairie species, including the paintbrush, will be propagated and replanted. Fencing, caging and snag development will all help reduce damage by deer and rodents. The preserve is one of only 11 sites in the world where golden paintbrush, a federally threatened, state endangered and globally imperiled species, survives. This preserve is one of the two largest remaining habitats for meeting federal and state recovery goals. Most remaining areas are less than 1 acre; this site includes 25 acres of prairie soils that could support the paintbrush. As a result of this project, prairie habitat will increase seven-fold from .5 acre to more than 3.5 acres, and the number of individual paintbrush plants will more than triple, from less than 100 to more than 350</div>')[0];

It represents a unique opportunity for protection of a large intact ecosystem with natural hydrologic functions. The properties proposed for acquisition include critical parts of Preacher&#39;s and Blue sloughs, sinuous tidally influenced waterways that wind through the heart of the surge plain. Sloughs such as this provide important off-channel habitat for juvenile salmonids during their adjustment to marine conditions. Habitat for other fish including the Olympic mud minnow is also protected within the wetland. Most of the site is Sitka spruce dominated forested wetland. Within the surge plain, nesting, roosting and foraging habitat is protected for eagles, osprey, great blue heron, waterfowl, shorebirds, and neo-tropical migrant species.

That plan also identified the County&#39;s primary role in meeting those deficiencies as providing large, regional &#34;Heritage Parks&#34; throughout the County. Heritage parks are sites large enough (300 acres, minimum) to remain largely undeveloped, while providing for passive active recreational needs and preserving environmentally sensitive areas. Since that plan was adopted, the County has acquired heritage park sites in South and Central Kitsap, but has no such facilities in North Kitsap (NK). The County conducted a thorough search for possible sites in NK, and an analysis of the top five sites. There was press coverage and public involvement in the selection process. The site chosen, by a wide margin, as best suited as a Heritage park is the subject of this application. It is 426.11 acres in size, with the potential for future expansion to double that size -- large enough to accommodate a wide range of active uses and trails, while protecting sensitive areas. It is conveniently located to the major population centers of NK: Poulsbo, Bainbridge Island, Kingston and Indianola. A large part of the site has soils and topography ideally suited for fields, for which there is a significant, documented need. The site contains environmentally sensitive headwater springs of Miller Creek -- a salmon stream on which the Suquamish Tribe has a fish hatchery.</div>')[0];

These preserves contain three imperiled wetland and bog ecosystems and seven very rare and/or high quality occurrences of wetland plant communities.  One of the plant communities found on Shumocher Creek Preserve, the Sitka alder/skunk cabbage - water parsley community, has a very restricted geographic range; it is only found in the Puget Trough ecoregion and is critically imperiled globally.  Inventories by two Natural Heritage scientists at the sites indicate that all of these wetland types and plant communities are in excellent condition.  Until very recently DNR did not own land at either site.  However, with the help of The Nature Conservancy, DNR purchased the majority of the Shumocher Creek site from a large timber company in June 2002.

Underwood Memorial Park. The park has three competition level softball fields, a parking area, and the infrastructure for future development of soccer fields, field lighting and additional parking.  Maximizing field use by adding lights is critical because Des Moines has 60% fewer sports fields per capita than the surrounding cities of Federal Way, SeaTac, and Kent. Restrooms to replace the use of sani-cans will improve user and spectator comfort and site sanitation.  The project improves the quality of athletic experiences by reducing conflicts between users caused by overlapping game times and daylight constraints. Having lighting to compensate for cloud cover and shortened daylight in the fall and winter months will also enhance game safety and lessen the need for local teams to search for practice and game fields away form home. Outstanding community involvement is the hallmark of Steven J. Underwood Memorial Park.

Following the Plan&#39;s adoption, Snohomish County Parks convened the Regional Recreation Task Force in 1995 to develop an action plan to provide the needed land and facilities. Of the issues identified in this plan, field supply was at the top of the list, followed by the unequal distribution of fields and facilities between established urban areas and the further-out UGAs (Urban Growth Areas) adjacent to the rural zones.Snohomish County Parks incorporated this information into the 2001 Comprehensive Parks Plan, which is providing a guide for current park site identification and acquisitions in the UGAs to meet these sports field demands.  This North County Ballfield proposal is an effort to address the ballfield supply shortage by acquiring a portion of the DNR Sisco 36 site located between the cities of Marysville and Arlington, both of which are experiencing significant residential growth and youth soccer and little-league baseball participation.  Currently the Marysville youth soccer groups are utilizing a school district property just across the street from our targeted site, but will be forced to relocate due to construction of an elementary school facility.

The basalt daisy&#39;s global distribution is limited to the southern half of the Yakima River Canyon and the adjacent Selah Creek Canyon.  The existing NAP encompasses more than 75% of this population.  This project will add to the proportion of the population that is protected, it will improve DNR&#39;s access to the site, and it will enhance DNR&#39;s ability to manage the site for its ecological values.  The remaining portion of the basalt daisy population is on the adjacent Yakima Training Center, managed by the U.S. Department of Defense, Fort Lewis.  The cliffs within the project area are identified as a priority habitat by the WA Department of Fish and Wildlife and are known to be used by Prairie Falcons and Golden Eagles.</div>')[0];

The proposed NAP is located on the west side of Whidbey Island. The site supports one of only 11 populations of golden paintbrush remaining in the world.  The Recovery Plan for golden paintbrush specifies that the protection of all existing populations is critical to the recovery of the species.  The owner of this site has divided the property into five waterfront view lots with the intention to sell them for residential development.  If not acquired now, one of the largest properties available for recovery of golden paintbrush will be permanently lost.  Through acquisition and management, this site has a high potential for meeting or exceeding federal recovery goals for the species, and will be ideal for testing restoration techniques for both golden paintbrush and the coastal prairie on which it depends.   This is a collaborative project between DNR and the Whidbey Camano Land Trust (WCLT).  The purchase price for the property is $2 million.  DNR and WCLT have already raised $1.5 million in federal funding.   The intent of this project is to acquire a conservation easement on the 33 acre site.

Bellevue is bounded on the west by Lake Washington and on the east by Lake Sammamish.  However, because of urban development, topography and the almost continuous private ownership of the shoreline, the public has limited visual and physical access to these lakes.  Of the over eleven miles of shoreline along the two lakes, less than ten percent is in public ownership.  Bellevue has made a substantial commitment over the past decade to increase its public presence along the waterfront, especially on Lake Washington.  Several parcels have been acquired between Meydenbauer Beach Park and the marina.  This linear connection is complete with the purchase of the waterfront parcels that are the subject of this grant proposal.Acquisition of the two remaining parcels (our Project Site) adds .5 acres and 146 linear feet of waterfront to the City&#39;s holdings and substantially completes the Lake Washington acquisition plan envisioned in the mid-1970&#39;s and implemented beginning in 1993.  These two properties are critical to the City&#39;s long-range vision for this area - a waterfront park that extends from Meydenbauer Beach Park to the marina, and a connection from that park to downtown Bellevue&#39;s commercial and residential areas and the Downtown Park.  Making this vision a reality will create a regionally significant waterfront destination.</div>')[0];

The targeted property is adjacent to the western edge of a future elementary school site, which shares it&#39;s northern boundary with a City park. The proximity of this facility to these resources will enhance their service as well as provide much needed athletic fields. Within the Monroe area, the need for sports fields is high.  There are currently 10 fields within the City park system and a handful of school and private fields.  These existing fields are heavily used and the level of demand has resulted in leagues seeking private properties (primarily agricultural) for use.  Recently, challenges to zoning enforcement have brought the use of agricultural fields for athletic fields into question.  The result to this challenge will likely result in the expulsion of teams from these fields.The proposed acquisition would create a multipurpose facility.  It is expected that the size of the acquisition would allow for several events to occur at the same time, maintenance could be easily accommodated and that tournament events could occur.  At this time, a commitment from the Sky River Soccer Club has been obtained for utilizing and maintaining the facility.  In addition, the adult soccer league has expressed a desire to use the facility and it is foreseen that utilization of the facility will be high due to the demand for fields in this area.</div>')[0];

There is a well-documented urgent need for protection of intact shrub-steppe habitat in Washington, and in particular for locating and protecting the remaining excellent examples.  Methow Rapids Natural Area Preserve (NAP), located along the Columbia River in southwestern Okanogan County, supports outstanding examples of two shrub-steppe communities that are among the least-protected and most limited in extent within the state:  smooth sumac/bluebunch wheatgrass and antelope bitterbrush/bluebunch wheatgrass.  Historically, these communities were most extensive in the Okanogan Valley and along portions of the Snake and Columbia Rivers.  Intact examples of these communities are now very limited due to historic overgrazing, as well as expanding agricultural and residential development.  This project seeks to substantially expand the existing NAP to include additional areas of these plant communities, which are classified by the Natural Heritage Program as Priority 1 and Priority 2, respectively.  This will add significantly to the statewide protection of these communities, enhance the long-term viability of the site, and provide a protected habitat connection to the Columbia River.</div>')[0];

The facility is planned to provide a free, safe and accessible location for youth in the Sunnyside / Grandview area to develop their skills in this noncompetitive sport.  Sunnyview Park is owned by the City of Sunnyside, and is already equipped with soccer fields, softball fields, playground equipment, drinking water and handicapped accessible restrooms.  This project has been in the planning stages for nearly six years and is ready to proceed.  During that time Yakima County Parks Dept, City staff from Sunnyside and Grandview, the Lower Yakima Valley Rural Enterprise Community and dozens of community youth and adult volunteers have worked on fundraising, youth surveys, feasibility study development and consideration of liability issues.  Professional skatepark designers met with local youth to get input on park design.  The Skatepark will consist of a 100&#39; x 100&#39; concrete slab with five modular steel obstacles.   The chosen design will allow for low maintenance, durability and periodic movement of the skating elements to provide a challenge for beginning and experienced skaters alike.  Additional elements may also be added to the park in the future if desired.     </div>')[0];

The old facility utilized mostly hand-made wooden modular equipment that deteriorated, became unsafe, and had to be removed. Based on enthusiastic public input from over 50 future users, the new skatepark will feature mostly street elements. It will be approximately 10,000 square feet, and will have an adjoining unisex restroom. It has been centrally located for convenience of the majority of its users (i.e. Bremerton Middle School, Junior High, and High School students). Since the new skatepark will be located in an existing park (i.e. Eastpark), there will be no costs for land acquisition, and significant savings will be gained by being able to tap into existing utilities, and utilizing an existing parking lot.  The current Bremerton Parks &amp; Recreation Comprehensive Plan states that additional neighborhood parks are needed, and one of the most requested listing is a skatepark. For the past two years, Bremerton Skateboarders and Supporters United (BSSU) have actively been pushing for a new Skate Facility, and in conjunction with the City&#39;s Parks and Recreation Department have been instrumental in acquiring approximately $150,080 in matching funds.

This phase of the project will secure the critical habitats that are under-represented in the protected land base and link them to existing agency holdings. The target parcels will help protect the largest privately-owned, contiguous block of shrub-steppe habitat remaining in the watershed, along with four miles of Beaver Creek frontage and two miles of Methow River frontage in a critical area for sharp-tailed grouse, spring Chinook and Upper Columbia steelhead. In addition, these acquisitions will protect biologically-rich riparian forests and provide important habitat for riparian songbirds, furbearers, amphibians and many other priority species.   The target parcels connect to public land and link critical riparian components to protected uplands. Maintaining connectivity will prevent fragmentation, maximize habitat effectiveness, and facilitate wildlife movements within the watershed. No other major inhabited watershed in the state offers such opportunity for comprehensive protection of fish and wildlife resources and associated recreation.

These properties are highly threatened by development and are a crucial part of a larger project area that contains the highest quality occurrence of a rare forest community type and a variety of high quality wildlife habitats.  More than 98 percent of similar mature forest conditions (&gt;100 years old) in the Puget Trough ecoregion have been lost since European settlement.  The project area is one part of a much larger landscape-scale area of managed forest lands on the western Kitsap Peninsula that form one of the most important landscapes for biodiversity conservation in the Puget Trough.  Stavis Creek, which runs through the site, is one of the best remaining Hood Canal salmon spawning habitats and is a designated recovery area for threatened Hood Canal summer chum.  High-quality freshwater wetlands located on the properties form the headwaters of the creek and have habitat for cavity-nesting ducks.  The site also hosts an active Bald Eagle nest, a small Great Blue Heron rookery, breeding Mountain Quail, Chinook Salmon, Cougar, and Black Bear.  The objective is to protect all functionally connected natural-regeneration forests and high-quality wetlands from development, timber harvest, and other commercial uses.  This project greatly enhances the long-term viability and quality of wildlife habitat in a still-intact functional landscape that is threatened with urban fragmentation.</div>')[0];

The Discovery Trail is a ten-foot-wide paved non-motorized trail that will run from the city of Ilwaco&#39;s waterfront, west to the state park, and then northerly along the beach to the city of Long Beach.  While the trail traverses a portion of the state park, it does not provide access to major attractions. State Route 100 provides motorized access to the park, but due to site and environmental constraints, the substandard road cannot be widened or rerouted to accommodate a bike lane.  The road is quite narrow and presents an extremely hazardous condition for hikers and bikers.  This project will construct two miles of trail, grade separated, but running mostly parallel to SR100, to provide non-motorized access from the Discovery Trail to the main State Park hub.  This hub, known as the Isthmus, contains the park administrative headquarters, a campground, boat launch, major interpretive facilities and beach.  The project will provide a safe route into the park and will provide a significant expansion of recreational opportunities for visitors using the Discovery Trail.

Specifically, construction of the one-third mile multiple-use trail will add a link to the I-90 cross-state trail and connect two regional trails: the Issaquah-High Point and East Lake Sammamish Regional Trails. This linkage will serve non-motorized trail users from the Cities of Seattle, Bellevue, Issaquah, Redmond, and Sammamish and will fill one of the six identified gaps in the I-90 Trail/Mountains to Sound Greenway Trails System that begins at the Seattle waterfront and follows I-90 across the Cascade Mountain Range to the Columbia River.This missing link is located within the city-owned First Avenue NE right-of-way and is located between the Sunset/I-90 Interchange (Exit #18) and East Lake Sammamish Parkway in the City of Issaquah. With construction of this segment of the I-90 cross-state trail, several local, regional, and statewide non-motorized trail objectives will be met. The City of Issaquah, King County, and WSDOT have identified in their respective planning documents that completion of the regional and statewide trail system is a high priority as a non-motorized and recreational trail corridor. The proposed project design is for a grade-separated ten-foot wide asphalt paved trail with two-foot graveled shoulders.</div>')[0];

Several other agencies/organizations are committed to restoration and conservation of south Puget Sound Prairie communities including the US Fish and Wildlife Service, The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Fort Lewis, and Thurston County Parks. TNC, with the assistance of several partners, drafted the &#34;South Puget Sound Prairies Site Conservation Plan&#34; to serve as the basis for future conservation and restoration efforts. This regional plan highlights 4 additions to existing prairie and oak woodland reserves: Tenalquot: Though there has been little reconnaissance of this privately owned land, native prairie plant communities are probably in poor condition. Appropriate prairie soils are extensive, so the likelihood of successful restoration is high. Scatter Creek has high quality native prairie (Idaho fescue-white-topped aster grassland) and a riparian strip of mature oak. West Rocky: includes approximately 300 acres of mounded prairie, 400 acres of wetlands, and 40 acres of oak woodland. Mima Mounds contains high quality Idaho fescue-Puget Balsamroot prairie and land with high potential for prairie restoration. Many species of plants and animals dependent on the prairie and oak woodland communities are found on these sites. This list of rare species includes 2 federally threatened, 3 federal candidate, and 5 species of concern.  This project by DNR will target the Mima Mounds properties.</div>')[0];

The trail will be 12&#39; wide and is designed for users with both daily and leisure time travel needs.  The project will redevelop and restore an historic dock and over water railroad trestle.  The trail will provide access to unique natural features along Bellingham Bay and will serve as a non-motorized bypass around roadway, railway and topographic barriers.  It links neighborhoods in south Bellingham with a saltwater beach and an existing waterfront community park.

Our current playground and basketball court are inadequate and unsafe and do not meet the needs of our community.  Our playground has several drawbacks as it does not meet current safety requirements, it is small and it is not age appropriate for a toddler population, it does not have an ADA accessible pathway from the parking lot which the Town will include in this project.  Our basketball court which is utilized heavily during spring and summer has a cracked surface.  The Town would like to construct a new playground that would be age appropriate for toddler to school age children which will stand up to our cold winters.  Our basketball court wold be resurfaced with a rubberized material that would be more safe and functional.

This will be accomplished by purchasing 14 acres of mixed coniferous and deciduous forest, wetlands that are hydrologically connected to Issaquah Creek and a riparian corridor along 900 feet of both sides of Issaquah Creek. Additionally, approximately 700 feet of both sides of three salmon-bearing tributaries to Issaquah Creek will be protected.The parcels are a key component of the overall Issaquah Creek Waterways Program; a Program committed to preserving the best riparian habitat along Issaquah basin streams. The parcels provide a link in the wildlife corridor that incorporates Tiger Mountain and Squak Mountain State Forests, Taylor Mountain Forest and other protected forests and connects to the City of Seattle watershed (90,000 acres). In addition to the on-site habitat benefits, the forests and wetlands throughout this reach are essential to the protection of water quantity, water quality and aquatic habitat for all of Issaquah Creek and Lake Sammamish. These parcels, in addition to the 118-acre Log Cabin Natural Area just downstream, provide passive recreation opportunities for Issaquah residents and the general public. Issaquah Creek supports ESA-listed Chinook, char (possibly ESA-listed bull trout), sockeye, coho, kokanee, steelhead and cutthroat. Issaquah Creek is considered a Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 8 core area for Chinook production and the reach has been identified as a high priority acquisition site in the WRIA 8 Chinook Conservation Plan, Issaquah Waterways 2000 and the King County Greenprint.</div>')[0];

This field has deteriorated to such a condition that it is playable three months less a year when compared to other fields in the immediate area as well as being the last to receive lights.This renovation work will include leveling, sand layer, drainage, fencing, backstops, dugouts, and installation of field lighting.  We expect these changes to increase the length of the play season and improve the quality of the play environment.  In addition we expect this renovation to save the Parks and Recreation Department money in maintenance.  The field currently must be mowed in a time-consuming manner with hand mowers as the more efficient but heavy tractor mowers sink in and damage the wet field.  Additionally, the improvement of this field will contribute economically to the community in tourism dollars generated on tournament weekends.Skagit Playfields Complex is part of an inter-local agreement signed in 1978 between Skagit County and Skagit Valley College.  This project is supported and utilized by a number of organizations.

Presently there are no skateparks or areas where skating is allowed within a 40 mile radius.  The lack of a facility generates damage and public nuisance.  This skate park, in addition to providing much needed recreation, will foster relations between area youth, businesses, homeowners, and law enforcement.  Phase 1 development will take the form of an outdoor skatepark consisting of a series of ramps, benches, and other elements specific to these alternative sports. Future phases of the project will include the addition of other skating apparatus and park amenities.  The skatepark will be free to the public and its design will accommodate both beginning and more experienced skates.  This safe, drug free environment will make use of the existing E.J. Miller Park facilities which includes parking, lighting, and restroom.  It is important to note that the skatepark will be constructed of concrete which is low maintenance. This is a partnership project between Prosser Kiwanis Club, the city of Prosser, and the private sector.

The City of Lacey will acquire approximately 3.16 miles through railbanking. This project will acquire the .3 mile gap between the railbanked segments.  If this project is successful and the land can be purchased at this time, a complete 3.16-mile section of rail corridor will be preserved for trail use.The corridor runs through the heart of Lacey&#39;s core business district. It provides connections between the business district, residential neighborhoods, a variety of City parks, the Community Center, the Senior Center, and Long Lake. Lacey currently lacks adequate trail options for pedestrians, roller bladers, joggers, and recreational bicyclists. The trail promises to be a popular facility since it provides views of Mt. Rainier, historic buildings and forests, and provides access to wetlands, lakes, and streams.The corridor is part of a regional trail network that connects the Thurston County communities of Lacey, Olympia, Tumwater, Yelm, Rainier, Tenino, and Bucoda. It will provide an east-west connection to the north-south Chehalis Western trail and a westerly connection with Olympia&#39;s Woodland Trail. Once the trail is developed, users will have access to Weyerhaeuser forest properties, the State Capitol, Olympia&#39;s downtown, Watershed Park, and Woodard Bay.</div>')[0];

This site allows the City to address all the sporting needs of the community in a centrally located area of Kent where 80% of the City&#39;s population resides. There is no other park like in the state or the in the country. This development will set the precedent for the development of a multi-use facility that incorporates such diverse sports and user groups while allowing the general public a venue to educate and appreciate these &#34;extreme&#34; sporting activities.</div>')[0];

This project, the &#34;Enumclaw Trails Project,&#34; will develop the first section of trail from State Highway 410 near Veterans Memorial Park south to the Enumclaw - King County boundary. The proposed trail would consist of a 10&#39; wide asphalt path approximately one mile in length. The trail corridor includes an open section that provides great views of Mt. Rainier and another section that is wooded providing a more secluded / park like type of experience. This connection southward will someday provide access to the White River, and ultimately the Foothills Trail in Pierce County. King County Parks has purchased ten acres along the White River at the location where the trail will cross the river.The Trail Project will satisfy a tremendous need in the Enumclaw area. The City conducted a community survey during the development of the Park Plan in 1998 and trail development was indicated as the top desire/need by the community members completing the survey. The City has no developed trails within the community at this time. This shortfall of trail inventory in Enumclaw was determined during the development of the Enumclaw Parks and Recreation Parks Plan, adopted in 1998, and the Enumclaw Trails Master Plan, which was adopted in 2000. Our vision, is to someday see Enumclaw and Buckley connected with this trail corridor.</div>')[0];

These sites are adjacent to the 8,500-acre Schlee Ranch, which is comprised of salmonid bearing streams, riparian buffers and steppe habitat located within the Asotin Creek Watershed. The Schlee Ranch is rich in priority species (steelhead, bull trout, Chinook salmon, bald eagle, elk, mule deer) and priority habitats (riverine, riparian, wetlands, steppe, caves and talus slopes). Bordered on 3 sides by public lands, the Ranch provides critical connectivity to fish and wildlife habitats on adjoining public lands.Funds in this project will buy sites adjacent to the Ranch. The entire project would be managed as part of WDFW&#39;s Asotin Creek Wildlife Area. Acquiring and protecting these properties will address watershed problems identified in the Asotin Creek Model Watershed Plan (1995) and protect downstream public lands. Similarly, the Asotin Creek Subbasin Summary (2001), prepared for the NW Power Planning Council, identified acquisition and protection of key private lands as a main goal in ensuring the future for fish and wildlife populations, including federally listed steelhead, Chinook salmon and bull trout. The larger project includes 29 miles of tributary and intermittent streams (5.5 miles of which are anadromous fish bearing; 26 steelhead redds were located on site in 2001). Acquisition protects steppe obligate species, approximately 350 wintering elk and will allow reintroduction of extirpated sharp-tailed grouse.  Grant funds may also be used for surveying, fencing and other incidentals associated with all Asotin Creek Watershed acquisitions.</div>')[0];

The current emphasis is to secure the most critical habitats under-represented in the protected land base, and link these parcels to existing agency holdings. Targeted parcels will protect the largest privately owned, contiguous block of shrub-steppe habitat remaining in the Methow Watershed, along with 5 miles of Beaver Creek frontage, and 4 miles of Methow River frontage along a critical stream reach. This will provide critical habitat for sharp-tailed grouse, spring chinook and Upper Columbia steelhead. In addition, these acquisitions will protect biologically rich riparian forests, providing important habitat for riparian songbirds, furbearers, amphibians and many other priority species.  Targeted parcels connect to public land and ink critical riparian components to protected uplands.  Maintaining connectivity will prevent fragmentation, maximize habitat effectiveness and facilitate wildlife movements within the watershed.  No other major inhabited watershed in the state offers such opportunity for comprehensive protection of fish and wildlife resources and associated recreation.

Balch Lake and Sondino Ponds have the best remaining habitat in the state and have the largest of two natural western pond turtle populations. In addition, this site contains some of the best remaining oak-pine savannah/grassland habitat in Klickitat County. This acquisition will provide an additional 42 acres of habitat to the existing western pond turtle habitat area. This area will provide additional grassy savannah for turtle nesting, cliffs and talus for raptors and reptiles, and nesting habitat for neotropical migrant birds. The large oaks and pines on this site provide critical habitat for several cavity nesting species and the western gray squirrel, a Washington threatened species. The additional acreage provides a buffer to further land divisions and development adjacent to the critical wildlife habitat.</div>')[0];

In Washington, they currently exist in 8 small, isolated populations, all of which are declining. The major factors contributing to the decline of sharp-tailed grouse populations include conversion, degradation, and isolation of shrub-steppe habitat. Several publications have recommended the acquisition and enhancement of strategically located habitats to ensure the long-term survival of sharp-tailed grouse. The key location for acquisition is the Dyre Hill area of northern Douglas County; 1) the habitat is predominantly shrub-steppe, 2) the topography is suitable, 3) the higher elevation and moist climate are advantageous for restoration and maintenance of habitat, 4) Dyre Hill is bordered on three sides by valleys of native habitat that extend down to the Columbia River, and 5) the area is adjacent to 2 state-owned wildlife areas with small sharp-tailed grouse populations. The proposed acquisition will address all major factors contributing to the declines of sharp-tailed grouse by converting croplands back to shrub-steppe, enhancing existing habitat, and integrating &#34;isolated&#34; areas into a larger sharp-tailed grouse management area. This strategy ultimately will support a larger &#34;meta-population&#34;, rather than the current isolated &#34;sub-populations&#34; which ultimately are faced with extinction.</div>')[0];

This type of ecosystem is of major conservation concern due to historic losses and ongoing degradation. In addition, a fish-bearing stream inside a steep forested ravine runs through the heart of the site.  The site supports two state threatened and two sensitive plant species, and four rare or threatened animal species: Larch Mountain Salamander, Peregrine Falcon, Slender-billed Nuthatch, and Lower Columbia Steelhead.  The proposed combination of Natural Resource Conservation Area and Natural Area Preserve will complement existing conservation work within the project area by DNR&#39;s partners, which include the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Steigerwald National Wildlife Refuge), U.S. Forest Service (Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area), and the Columbia Land Trust.

WWRP Funding: $105,867    Desc.: This proposal is to acquire a neighborhood park in one of the older Bellingham neighborhoods.  The Sunnyland neighborhood is centrally located in Bellingham, but lies on the edge of an industrial area.  The neighborhood is rebounding from years of decline as young families move into the area, seeking affordable, conveniently located housing.In 1996, during the update of their neighborhood plan, Sunnyland residents expressed a need for a park in the core of their neighborhood - the closest existing parks are located on the other side of busy arterial streets.  The identified project site as the last pleasant open site available for a park in the neighborhood.  In 1999, neighborhood residents applied for and received a Community Development Block Grant Neighborhood Initiative Program Grant so that the City of Bellingham could purchase the site.  The site was acquired in May 2000 under a waiver of retroactivity.  This acquisition will provide a much needed park and stimulate other improvements in an otherwise unserved neighborhood.  The City has committed funds to augment the acquisition reimbursement and the park can be developed in 2002.</div>')[0];

The residents of the Cascade View neighborhood voted to be annexed into the City of Tukwila in 1990.  Unfortunately, King County neglected to plan for local parks in this high-density residential area.  The nearest developed park is about one mile away, after crossing the five-lane Highway 99.The Park Plan public information gathering meetings identified that a park for the Cascade View Neighborhood was the most important park need in the City of Tukwila.City Council promised the annexed citizens (in 1990) that a park would be built for them.  In June 2000, the City Council was finally able to authorize the acquisition of 2.18 acres for our park.  One crucial 0.19-acre lot could not be purchased due to the seller&#39;s and City&#39;s financial situation.Currently, children are playing in the streets or in their apartments&#39; parking lots.  The proposed park location is one of the only Cascade View areas without sidewalks.  Everyone has to walk on  the side of the street.  A park pathway and street sidewalk will be constructed as part of the park development.This grant proposal to acquire the 0.19-acre Humiston Property will meet the number Park Plan priority, will fulfill an eleven-year old City Council promise, and most importantly, meet many recreational and safety needs of the neighborhood.</div>')[0];

This project has unprecedented support from the public in general including almost every outdoor associated sports organization in the state as well as local, county, state and federal government.  The Methow River watershed is a uniquely rich and diverse ecosystem that is undergoing rapid residential subdivision, fueled by the esthetic and wildlife amenities this project strives to protect. Mule deer corridors and winter ranges were identified through cooperative research projects funded by the US Forest Service and WDFW; 95% of this herd (about 20,000) moves on average 30 miles between summer range in the high North Cascades and winter range in the Methow Valley.  Bull trout and anadromous fish stocks including steelhead and salmon have been listed as threatened/endangered in this watershed. Residential subdivision is destroying and threatening the remaining winter range and migration corridors for Washington&#39;s largest migratory mule deer herd. Preserving these upland, migration and riparian corridors for deer and other wildlife is upstaged only by the protection this project will afford threatened and endangered fish stocks in the Methow River and its&#39; tributaries.</div>')[0];

Salmon Creek is the stronghold of ESA listed Strait of Juan de Fuca summer chum salmon. 1999 returns exceeded the summer chum returns to all other Strait of Juan de Fuca streams combined.  It&#39;s stable spawning habitat and high quality estuarine rearing habitat are essential to the survival of this salmon stock. Salmon Creek also contains the highest seasonal concentration of white sturgeon in Washington (1995 &amp; 96 data).  ESA listed Puget Sound Chinook likely use the estuary for rearing, and coho salmon, steelhead and cutthroat spawn in both Salmon and Snow Creeks. Shorebirds, waterfowl and shellfish are abundant in the estuary.  Bald and Golden eagles feed on salmon carcasses along the creeks and in the intertidal areas. Roosevelt elk use the site. The project area encompasses about 300 areas of prime habitat proposed for easement or acquisition. Included are the estuary and associated tidelands, wetlands and riparian corridors that together contain nearly 2 miles of beach and 3 miles of anadromous stream. This is a single-phase project to protect fish and wildlife habitat. Other elements (public access, interpretive and wildlife viewing facilities) could be incorporated later.The scope of this project is to complete demolition of structures on the Andrews and Larrance properties, which were acquired with funding through the Salmon Recovery Funding Board.</div>')[0];

Mount Si is a prominent scenic landscape along I-90 and is an important part of the Mountains to Sound Greenway, in addition to being an extremely popular conservation area due to its close proximity (25 minutes) to the Seattle urban area.  Primary features include critical wildlife habitat and travel connectors, scenic views and hiking trails.  A diversity of wildlife including mountain goats, bears, coyotes, cougar, bobcat, deer, elk and a variety of birds and small mammals inhabit the site.  Properties proposed for acquisition are threatened with conversion to incompatible and ecologically irreversible uses such as mining, residential and commercial uses.  Proposed additions to the NRCA will help connect the NRCA and other natural areas in the Cascade Range, including the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River and the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area.</div>')[0];

The five sites contained in this acquisition are located in the Upper and Middle Bear Creek Conservation Areas. All five sites are forested with a mix of upland and wetland habitats including mature forests and wetlands that are hydrologically connected to Bear Creek. Four of the five parcels are contiguous with King County conservation lands that are protected in perpetuity. Six different species of salmon including ESA-listed Chinook salmon use these sites for spawning, rearing, and migration. Bears, cougars, bobcats, pileated woodpeckers, western redback salamanders, and fresh water mussels have been documented on several of these sites. In addition to the documented species, many other wildlife species would be expected to occupy or use these sites based on the contiguity and variety of habitat types these parcels offer.Over the past 10 years, the five jurisdictions sharing the Bear Creek basin have conserved over 2000 acres of excellent wildlife and salmon habitat. Fall salmon runs to the Bear Creek system annually average between 20,000 and 60,000 returning adults. In addition, conservation lands are adopted by a community group called Water Tenders who conduct planting, nonnative plant removal, and clean up events about four times a year.</div>')[0];

Currently, boaters who run the middle segment of the Middle Fork (Class III-IV whitewater) with non-motorized craft access the river and shoreline via a King County right-of-way at Tanner Road, approximately one-half mile upstream from the proposed project site. As this segment of the river has become more popular with boaters, conflicts with neighboring residents have intensified.In preparing its River Corridor Public Use Concept (1997-IAC funded), the Middle Fork Task Force, a group of federal, state and local agency officials, user group representatives, and interested citizens, identified the proposed project site as a critical put-in/take-out site for boaters. Given the site&#39;s proximity to a popular regional trail, other facilities recommended include a parking area, connecting trails, a restroom facility, and trash receptacles. King County&#39;s Cedar River Trail Master Plan identified the need for a trailhead facility in this section of the trail in 1994, noting the area&#39;s rural valley character, mountain views and potential for river access.This project application is supported by Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust, Mid Fork Outdoor Recreation Coalition, the Issaquah Alps/Upper Snoqualmie Interagency Committee, the North Bend Parks Commission and the Washington Kayak Club.</div>')[0];

Our rapid residential growth coupled with slow growth in industry severely taxes the city&#39;s ability to fund needed recreational facilities.Although managed by West Richland, this project will serve Benton City, Kiona and the entire Tri-City area.Legal description of project:  Sec 8, T9N, R28E, W.M., West Richland, Benton County, WA.   Bombing Range Sports Complex  Master Plan, is affixed as  Attachment A to this Agreement.</div>')[0];

The first acquisition phase, assisted by a grant from last year&#39;s IAC process, is for purchase of approximately 10 acres.  Phase II seeks to acquire an additional 10 acres for a total of 20 acres. The City&#39;s intent for this park is to make it Lakewood&#39;s second community park, providing a loop trail system, a group picnic area, a youth only fishing dock, playground equipment, a restroom, and access to natural and landscaped vegetation.  Wards Lake is a very attractive wetland area with a variety of tree stands, including rare large oaks.  As Lakewood is 90% developed, it has very few opportunities for preservation of suitable additional open space for public access.   At present, there are no public parks to serve this corner of the City with 9000 residents.  The closest park in Lakewood is nearly two miles away.  All 20 acres comprising Phase I and II are part of an estate.  The heirs to the property strongly prefer that the site be converted to a park, as they grew up on the site and do not wish to see it developed residentially.  Their willingness to sell the property significantly below the appraised value is an indication of their affinity for the property and their civic interest.The Legal Description of the property to be acquired is described in Exhibit A, which is by this reference incorporated into the Project Agreement.</div>')[0];

This acquisition would be an expansion project of an existing three-acre site owned by King County park system and would allow for future development of a community park, including athletic fields, basketball, play area, picnic area, and access to a regional trail.The area of Preston is severely under served for active recreational opportunities.  There are no local parks within its service area to meet these needs. The park will serve a local need by providing a Community Park as well as meet local regional needs for athletic fields.  The athletic fields will serve the Snoqualmie Valley Little League and Youth Soccer Assoctiation.   These leagues have seen a 50% increase over the last four years.  Leagues have had to limit practices and number of games because there is a shortage of fields.The project has been through extensive public review and is tremendously supported.  In 1997, the King County Council unanimously adopted the Preston Vision which includes the acquisition of this land for a community park.  The Preston Vision is endorsed by the Mountains to Sound Greenway, Issaquah Alps Trails Club and the Preston Community Club.</div>')[0];

The project area was annexed into Kent in April 1993. With the exception of an elementary school across the street, the area is void of any park areas. The site is situated in a densely populated neighborhood and has view areas of the Green River Valley and Olympic Mountains. There is tremendous support for the acquisition and development of a park to serve this neighborhood.  In 1996, several community ad hoc meetings and two public hearings were held to determine the type of park the citizens wanted.  Three additional ad hoc meetings and two public hearings were held this year to finalize the master plan for this property.

The plan calls for construction of the community&#39;s first illuminated basketball facility, enhancement of existing passive recreation areas, and the formalization of existing parking areas.  The need for these improvements has been noted in several public opinion surveys, the City&#39;s Comprehensive Plan and many city council meetings.  The resulting improvements will enhance public and disabled access to the existing facilities, address the need for a basketball court, improve pedestrian circulation within the park, and ease congestion on adjacent streets by providing and improved parking area.  When completed, Osprey Park will have 37 additional parking stalls, 600 feet of new walking paths, a lit basketball court, one horseshoe pit, and 9 picnic tables and benches.  The Project has strong community support.  A number of local businesses, developers, and community groups have pledged money, labor, materials, and equipment to the effort.  A series of fund raising events sponsored by local youth have drawn continuing support from citizens from with Sultan and the surrounding communities.  This project will complete phase 2 of the community&#39;s most successful active recreation facility and serve as a symbol of what grass roots support can accomplish.</div>')[0];

The Community&#39;s existing fields are all tightly located on the high school campus.  The only full size baseball field is scheduled with priority use for boys Varsity and Jr. Varsity teams.  The school also owns a 60&#39; baseline field for boys&#39; Little League use, which will be converted to other uses in the next two years.  Girls&#39; softball teams must vie for practice time on two undrained, unirrigated areas known as the &#34;cow pasture&#34; fields.  Due to the limited space available at the high school, practicing teams must frequently play into each other&#39;s outfields.  An additional field - the first of three planned at the new Whitehorse Community Park - will effectively double the community&#39;s playspace, and ensure that girl&#39;s sports teams and adult leagues can also take advantage of quality playing conditions.  Phase 1 consists of one full size (90&#39; baseline) drained, irrigated baseball field and gravel parking lot for 90 cars.  Future phases will complete two additional baseball fields, and one adult soccer field.  The Town of Darrington and the surrounding community enthusiastically support the project, and have offered a significant amount of donated labor and equipment.</div>')[0];

The saltwater estuary at the mouth of Shinglemill Creek (Fern Cove) was purchased in 1994 with  IAC funding. Phase II will protect the upstream elements that are essential salmon habitat: the braided stream channel; the wetlands bordering the stream; the forested walls of the stream canyon; and a buffer on either side. IAC funds will be used to purchase 116 acres that include the stream channel and the headwaters and to cover costs associated with conservation easements that will limit future development on another 139 acres, thereby providing a crucial buffer.  A dozen landowners have already agreed to donate these conservation easements.  Apart from the IAC supported portion of the project, another 69 acres of the canyon will be acquired by trading it for other land owned by King County.  In total, over 320 acres will be protected. The project will be completed by 2003 with protection of the remaining portion of the uplands.</div>')[0];

As a result of annexations over the past five years, the City has quadrupled in population and tripled in land area.  The City now includes more than two miles of lake frontage, but  the lakefront is completely developed with single family residences and two private clubs.  There is no public access to the lake in Lake Forest Park.  The closest public lake access in Matthews Beach in Seattle-five miles to the south, or Log Boom Park in Kenmore-1/2 mile to the east.  With the purchase of this anchor property, the City has its first opportunity to provide lake access.This site is critical to the City&#39;s ability to provide a lakefront park.  Most lakefront property in the City is approximately 5,000 sf, this site is 3/4 acre.  Its location next to the Burke Gilman Trail and across the street from the LFP shopping center, the library and future City Hall provide an opportunity to create a City center.  Additionally, the landowners adjacent to and east of this site have expressed interest in selling their parcels to the City. This future acquisition would enable the City to provide additional active recreational elements including playground and picnic areas.The City proposes to develop the site as a public park.  Amenities will include wading beach; canoe and kayak access point and rents; lawn games, parking, bike racks, seating areas and restrooms.</div>')[0];

The pool was built in 1966 with funds donated by the Wagner Family and is the only public pool in the Methow Valley.  The pool is a popular summer recreation site and is used by the local swim team for training &amp; meets.  Currently the mechanical filtration system poses health &amp; safety hazards, the tank cannot be drained &amp; is in poor condition, the pool lacks ADA accessibility, and there is no wading area for familites with small children.  The pool has long-standing public support. During recent planning efforts, Twisp residents placed an urgent priority on upgrading the pool to meet safer standards &amp; better serve the community needs.  Currently, a bequest in the amount of $250,000 from the Wagners is available for pool renovations.  Renovation priorities include new mechanical systems; tank, deck, &amp; bathhouse improvements; addition of a wading pool, water slide, bleachers, &amp; lighting; and development of accessible bathrooms for use by pool &amp; park users.  With the accomplishment of this project, Twisp will be able to offer a wonderful summer recreation facility for families from the outlying area.

This will be the first park that Lakewood will acquire and develop since incorporation. Lack of adequate parks was one of the primary reasons that Lakewood citizens elected to incorporate. The McChord Gate neighborhood has been identified by city leadership as the highest priority for placing a new park because this isolated area of Lakewood currently has no public park facilities; nonetheless, it serves nearly 5,000 residents.  Our intent with this park is to make it an oasis of sorts for it&#39;s residents. We intend to construct a multipurpose field for baseball, football, and soccer; a playground for smaller children, and basketball courts are intended as well. The site will have a small restroom, as well as picnic amenities. A stream and small dirt road separate these two parcels. Lakewood should have an easement for the stream and road in the near future. Future development plans are to build a bridge to connect this acquisition with a smaller parcel (2.24 acres) located on the opposite side of the stream. This project is for acquisition and first phase development, which will essentially turn this site into a community park.A legal description of the properties to be acquired is described in Exhibit A, and is by this reference incorporated into the Project Agreement.</div>')[0];

Proposed facilities include a paved, barrier-free loop trail for off-street walking, biking or skating, a playground, picnic shelter and sites, a basketball court, tennis court, playfields, a restroom and a parking lot. Turf and landscape improvements will be made to improve play areas and to enhance the scenic beauty of the park.  Olympia&#39;s comprehensive plan recommends a neighborhood park within a 10-20 minute walk of every residence. As shown on the location map, this neighborhood does not have a park within the 1/2 mile service radius. During 1996, Olympia had the neighborhood associations nominate sites for neighborhood parks based on criteria developed by the community. Friendly Grove Park was acquired as a result of this process. In 1998, a park planning workshop was held with the neighborhood.  The neighbors will continue to be involved in future park planning, design and management decisions.</div>')[0];

In this first phase, the City of Lakewood will acquire nearly eight acres. In subsequent phases, Lakewood will develop this property into a grassy picnic area, taking advantage of its waterfront location and a natural grove of oak trees. Beyond that, the City will seek to acquire an additional 12 acres for a total of 20 acres. Much of this property secured in the second round of acquisition will be used for passive purposes. A trail that starts near the picnic area, follows the waterfront southerly, and then loops back though the woods to its original start point.  Currently, the nearest park in the City is two miles away. Tacoma has a park about 1.5 miles away, but I-5 serves as a physical barrier. This park would also help preserve open space in the northeastern area of the City where it is now in jeopardy.The legal description of the property to be acquired is described in Exhibit A, which is by this reference incorporated into the Project Agreement.</div>')[0];

The original plan was to develop the skate park in Fort Steilacoom Park. In response to a request from the Ciyt of Lakewood to locate the skating facility in a park site already owned by Lakewood, Interagency Committee Board Members approved changing the site to Kiwanis Park on March 9, 2000 as outlined in IAC Resolution 2000-08.  Kiwanis Park is three acres with a variety of active and passive recreational uses. This skate park will be a state-of-the-art in-ground 10,000 to 12,000 square feet concrete structure serving skaters of all skill levels.

The Omak Area population includes three distinct groups that are finding common ground and intercultural harmony through soccer.   Organized soccer began with parents organizing a league for just a few dozen children. In only twenty years, that developed to 700 in youth soccer, including teams from nearby Pascal Sherman Indian School; Hispanic adult leagues whose Sunday games are a popular social event drawing family crowds;  and high school varsity soccer.  The skill of volunteer coaches and leaders has even led to college soccer scholarships for Omak players.   Yet the sport has no field to call its own. Soccer is played on a field shared with the annual Colville Indian Encampment, held during Omak Stampede.  Encampment activities inevitably damage the field for soccer.  New, regulation fields - for soccer only - will be located in an undeveloped part of the park, turning a dust bowl into greenery.   East Side Park, with ball fields, swimming pool, RV camping areas, rodeo arena, and other recreation facilities serve a wide region beyond the city limits.  Park playfields are used by the Omak School District in lieu of developing its own fields.  The City has enlisted volunteer and in-kind contributions for building soccer fields, including the support of Colville Confederated Tribes.</div>')[0];

Primary features include critical wildlife habitat, scenic views and hiking trails.  It provides important travel corridors and habitat for a diversity of wildlife including: mountain goats, bears, coyotes, cougar, bobcat, deer, elk, and a variety of birds and small mammals.  It is a prominent scenic landscape along the I-90 corridor and an important part of the Mountains to Sound Greenway.  The remaining 3,200 acres of private properties proposed for acquisition are threatened with conversion to incompatible and ecologically irreversible uses such as mining, residential, and commercial lodges.  These proposed additions to the NRCA will help connect the NRCA and other natural areas in the Cascade Range to enhance the NRCA&#39;s role as a connecting corridor in a regional system of natural areas. The development portion of this proposal is to enhance visitor use and safety, improve aesthetics, control access, construct connector trail between Little Si and Mt.

The population of this species has steadily declined to the point that it was listed this year a a State Threatened Species. Since habitat loss is the most important factor in this decline, this project will seek acquisitions and conservation easements on the best remaining habitat in Douglas and Okanogan Counties.  Historically, great numbers of sharp-tails were found in the native shrub-steppe and grassland habitats of Eastern Washington. These habitats have steadily been converted first to agricultural use and recently to development and subdivision. Grassland habitat types of eastern Washington have been reduced from 25% of the landscape to 1%. The WA State Management Plan for Sharp-tailed Grouse&#34; has identified the protection of the remaining viable grassland, shrub-steppe and associated riparian habitats as key to the survival of the remaining sharp-tail populations. These sites are very diverse and other species that will benefit include sage thrasher, sage sparrow, loggerhead shrike, white-tailed jackrabbit and other shrub-steppe species.  This is Phase 3 of an ongoing project to protect key sites.  Funding for enhancement and operations of previously purchased sites has been provided by BPA Mitigation Program.  Further acquisition are also planned making BPA a full partner in our efforts to protect Washington&#39;s shrub-steppe habitats and wildlife species.The legal description of the properties to be acquired is described as follows:     Chesaw Unit - T40N, R29E. &amp; R30E.

This project has unprecedented support from the public in general including almost every outdoor associated sports organization in the state as well as local, county, state and federal government.  The Methow River watershed is a uniquely rich and diverse ecosystem that is undergoing rapid residential subdivision, fueled by the esthetic and wildlife amenities this project strives to protect.

Bull trout and anadromous fish stocks including steelhead and salmon have been listed as threatened/endangered in this watershed. Residential subdivision is destroying and threatening the remaining winter range and migration corridors for Washington&#39;s largest migratory mule deer herd.

The goal of this project is to secure the last of the best salmon spawning habitat in central Washington. Sockeye salmon, once widespread east of the Cascades, survive as viable runs only in the Canadian Okanogan and Wenatchee River watersheds. Fed by melting glaciers and draining to a deep, cold lake, the White River tributary is the factory of the Wenatchee basin, producing genetically distinct runs of sockeye and spring chinook, as well as steelhead and bull trout. Although protected by a wilderness area at its source and surrounded by national forest, the critical spawning &amp; rearing habitat for sockeye, chinook and steelhead in the White River lies within multiple private ownerships.  WDFW proposes to acquire title and conservation easements on 600 acres of riparian corridor, currently threatened by development interests. This proposal is a recommendation of the Mid-Columbia Habitat Conservation Plan, stating that in order to secure the future of these species, &#34;the principle means is to secure riparian habitat either in conservation agreements, easements or direct purchases.&#34; Acquisition and maintenance costs will be shared with HCP partners and the USFS. Volunteers from the Chelan-Douglas Land Trust are committed to the project.

Three sub-projects are identified within this project. The Methow River Agricultural Site would place 65 farm acres in conservation easements to limit subdivision and fence cattle from ,75 mile of the Methow&#39;s left river bank, while enhancing habitat by planting additional riparian vegetation. The Little Cub Cr. sub-project will reduce sedimentation from roadss, purchase timber rights and/or place cons. easements on 320 acres of timbered lands including a series of natural beaver ponds, wetlands, and 1.7 miles of stream channel in this vital tributary.  The Upper Methow sub-project will protect side channel habitats in the Upper Methow  below its confluence with Hancock Creek. Cattle currently cross the river to a 3/4 mile long island.  Four owners of ~30 acres of the island and the south-adjacent river bank, hope to use conservation easements to restrict grazing and protect prime habitat and refugia for juvenile fish provided by the island&#39;s side channels.

Fork Stillaguamish ELJ   WWRP Funding: $204,133    Desc.: A collaborative watershed restoration effort has been ongoing in the North Fork of the Stillaguamish since 1985.  The catalyst was a massive landslide in the Deer Creek Watershed.  This effort includes state, federal, local and local agencies, Indian tribes, conservation groups, educational institutions, small and large private landowners and interested citizens.  The present manifestation of this cooperative effort is in a reach scale habitat restoration effort located between River Mile 20 - 23 which is presently funded by State JFE funds and USEPA funds. The cooperators have surveyed, designed and engineered plans necessary to gain appropriate permits for the introduction of large woody debris mimicking stable log jams which provide critical habitat for anadromous and resident salmonid species.  Combining our existing funded effort with conservation easements and additional restoration dollars will provide a tremendous restoration opportunity.  This will be monitored over time to present data adequate to draw conclusions on its success.  Approximately 200 acres of land is targeted for acquisition via conservation easement.  The location of the project was chosen due to its high use for spawning Chinook salmon and their need for cover and holding habitats. Additionally, the same engineered log jam technology will be utilized to reduce sediment inputs from large landslides and unstable stream banks which are presently impacting salmon habitat.</div>')[0];

Of the 5 species of salmon in the watershed, 2 (chinook and coho) are listed by state and tribal agencies as &#34;depressed.&#34;  Nonpoint pollution has closed commercial shellfish beds at the river&#39;s outlet.  Pollution problems prompted the Department of Ecology to fund an early action watershed plan.  The 1990 plan (which included habitat actions) continues to be actively implemented under the guidance of the citizen/agency Stillaguamish Implementation Review Committee (SIRC).  This application arises from a 2-year effort by the SIRC and its member organizations to identify priority habitat protection and restoration sites.  Studies helped set priorities.  The Tulalip Tribe&#39;s coho habitat loss study (1997) found that a lack of rearing habitat severely restricts coho production.  A related study by the Corps of Engineers (1997) identified 3 sloughs on the mainstem as priority rearing habitat restoration sites.  This application proposes purchase of conservation easements on the 3 sloughs.  This will protect 105 acres of riparian habitat as a key step in slough restoration.  Eventually, 4600 lineal feet of valuable off-channel rearing habitat will be restored using other funds.  Through easements and future restoration projects, coho production could increase by an estimated 50,000 smolts/year while providing quality habitat for waterfowl, migratory birds, and other wildlife.</div>')[0];

Extensive ditching has eliminated nearly all of the rearing habitat associated with wetland--beaver pond complexes.  Remaining habitat is degraded and characterized by low oxygen levels, elevated temperatures, lack of forested riparian zones, heavy siltation of gravels, and loss of channel complexity.  These high priority and complimentary projects are key elements of an overall strategy recommended in a watershed assessment prepared in 1996 by the Port Gamble S&#39;Kallam Tribe, Wild Olympic Salmon, the Conservation District and Chimacum Valley residents, based on recommendations of the Dungeness/Quilcene Plan.  Protection of the remaining strongholds of the wild coho population is proposed through acquisition of riparian zone conservation easements and restoration of associated rearing habitat in 4 critical areas:  2 forested headwaters; a major wetland; and a forested ravine along the lower mainstem.  Water quality monitoring by the District and the Tribe will continue at established sites.  Jefferson Land Trust will establish an endowment to support site monitoring and enforcement.

The Creek is important to fish and wildlife, including coho salmon (SASSI depressed stock) and chum salmon, sea-run cutthroat trout, bear, otter, pileated woodpecker, great blue heron, osprey and bald eagle.  The stream corridor is unique because it contains a wide diversity of critical habitat types in good condition, including Miller Lake, large open-water wetlands, stream and estuary lagoon.  A portion of Port Gamble Bay at the mouth of the creek was decertified for shellfish harvest in 1996 due to fecal coliform pollution.  Subsequently, the creek was identified as a high priority for protection and restoration in the S. Port Gamble Bay Shellfish Closure Response Plan (part of the 1997 Upper Hood Canal Watershed Action Plan).  Major livestock fencing projects have been completed at several strategic locations. Long term protection of riparian zones along the creek is now the goal.  Community outreach to obtain conservation easements on the creek is included in the scope of work for the 1998 CCWF &#34;Port Gamble Bay Watershed Restoration Project.&#34;  Project partners are the Kitsap Conservation District, Kitsap Land Trust, Port Gamble S&#39;Klallam Tribe and Kitsap County.

Rainier Nat&#39;l Park &amp; its confluence with the Puget Sound in the Nat&#39;l Wildlife Refuge.  Recognizing its unique nature, the WA State Legislature in 1985 directed Ecology to develop a management plan for the river.  After SEPA review, including an EIS, the Nisqually River Management Plan was approved by the Legislature in 1987.  Subsequently, the NRMP was accepted by Ecology as a nonpoint pollution action plan.  The NRMP emphasizes protection of a Core Management Zone along the river and calls for acquisition of development rights in this zone.  The proposal cover 210 acres within the CMZ in Thurston Co. from RM 19.5 to 20.6.  According to Nisqually Tribal surveys, this is an area for salmon &amp; steelhead spawning &amp; rearing.  The land is divided into 8 lots from 20 to 33 acres each.  At present, the riparian habitat along this reach is sound; however, it is threatened with subdivision, home development within 200 ft of the river, and timber harvests.  The purpose of this project is to impose a permanent conservation easement on 6 of the 8 lots, providing a min. 200 ft. setback of native veg. along the river with no removal permitted, no subdivision of parcels, and the access to land for future riparian enhancement.  Also, a boundary line adjustment on 2 lots will create a 20 acre natural resource/open space parcel along the river.  An endowment will be established for monitoring and stewardship.</div>')[0];

Wetlands atop a glacial drumlin and surrounding oak scrub shrub uplands provides habitat for a priority species, the Purple martin), hawks, neotropical migrants, mountain beaver and various other wildlife species. Historically the site provided habitat for the Mazama pocket gopher. Oregon white oak above a shrub layer of western hazelnut constitutes the primary vegetation. Secondary vegetative community associated with the wetlands include Douglas spirea, willow, slough sedge, black cottonwood, red alder, cascara and a grove of quaking aspen. Native vegetation is sufficiently dense to hold back penetration of non-native vegetative species and retain the landscape&#39;s historical character.  Our parcel offers two priority habitat conservation areas of urban natural open space and oak woodlands. An adjacent recharge area for the region&#39;s scrub-shrub and forested areas will be protected by a native vegetation buffer.  Tacoma&#39;s Comprehensive Plan designates the site for open space and recreation. A community based task force has worked for 2 1/2 years to preserve the project with City Council support.  Our proposal request funds to acquire 23 acres of urban wildlife habitat.  Subsequent acquisitions and developments will provide an 80 acre site with trails, viewpoints, an interpretive center and 14 acres reserved for a neighborhood park.</div>')[0];

First, the purchase of the 14 acre parcel of Wapato Hills will satisfy previously identified recreational deficiencies and meet the pressing need for a neighborhood park in a rapidly developing area. Second, the local park will provide an anchor for natural wildlife habitat and wetlands area. While planned development for the neighborhood park includes a multipurpose play field, children&#39;s play area, hiking and bicycle trails, picnic areas and other park facilities, the project stands alone on its significant merits as a neighborhood park suitable for active as well as passive recreation.  Topography of the land is predominately level with hills gently sloping toward the glacial drumlin which yields an elevation approximately 150 feet above the surrounding neighborhood. The adjacent Wapato Hills setting for our neighborhood park is an area especially noted for abundant wildlife and vegetative cover, providing respite from the highly developed areas nearby.  The parcel is ideally suited as a neighborhood gathering place with ample acreage to allow group activities as well as more private retreats from encroaching urbanization.</div>')[0];

This park was purchased with the assistance of IAC funds in 1991.  Tremendous community pressure and an extensive 6 year planning process has resulted in the development of the park.  Before the City committed to constructing this much needed sports complex, many soccer leagues were scheduling fields in nearby cities, playing 2 games at a time on one field, compromising the quality and safety of play, and spreading tournaments over many different locations.  It is Federal Way League policy to accommodate all players.  This project will add lights to the complex of 4 soccer fields.  This will increase capacity, improve the quality and safety of play and allow youth early evening play in the winter and adult play after dark throughout the year.</div>')[0];

Lopez Island School District #144 has set aside two plus acres of land for tennis courts for public and school use.  Unique community fund-raising for this cooperative project has raised over $60,000 in cash donations from over 140 households of the estimated 650 households on the Island.  This is exceptionally broad-based support in a locale known for its independent thinkers! These funds, when matched by IAC will provide recreation for the community, for school students, and for the over 325,000 annual visitors to the Island, most of whom come to recreate.  At present, there are no tennis courts on Lopez Island while Orcas has three courts and San Juan, four.  Dedicated land will be graded from its present use as a livestock grazing field to turnkey tennis courts.  The public has been involved since the community tennis association was formed in June, 1994, at a publicly advertised meeting.  Two school committees, open to the public and including members of the community, selected the site. More public hearings were held in the process of obtaining the county permits required.</div>')[0];

The trail corridor is presently being acquired under an IAC grant; none of it is developed yet for public use.  The proposed project is to develop the first 1.8 mile trail section between the City of Port Townsend and Mill Road near SR20.  This trail segment travels along a spectacular stretch of shoreline, past wetlands, wildlife areas, and forest as well as passing industrial facilities such as the area&#39;s largest employer, the Port Townsend Paper Mill.  The trail will serve pedestrians and bicyclists, and will provide a separate equestrian path along all but the final 1/3 mile stretch in which geographical constraints preclude horses.  The main path will be surfaced with crushed rock.  There will be several interpretive waysides along the trail, scenic viewpoints, and facilities for picnicking.  All portions of the trail and trail amenities will be barrier free and fully accessible.</div>')[0];

Kennewick youth and parents formed a committee in September 1995 to plan, design and raise funds for the construction of a skate park.  The goal is to provide alternative athletic recreational opportunities for youth/young adults in a positive environment. There are many skateboard and roller-blade enthusiasts in Kennewick. This facility will provide a place where they can socialize, learn new skating techniques, and display skills without becoming a nuisance or liability to property owners. The skaters, which include a number of &#34;At-Risk-Youth,&#34; are mostly impressionable youth who are not interested in traditional organized sports.  Kennewick&#39;s goal is to provide positive recreational opportunities so these youth will have a network of peers, interested adults and coaches to help them make good &#34;life choice&#34; decisions.  The approved skate park site is in a highly used area with lots of adult and police supervision. This area has access to restrooms and concessions and is near a transit transfer point.

It will terminate at the Emerson Street Bicycle Path, which provides direct access to Fisherman&#39;s Terminal and connects to other bicycle facilities leading to popular waterfront parks such as Chittenden Locks, Discovery Park, and Myrtle Edwards/Elliott Bay as well as to downtown Seattle.IAC funds will be used to acquire about 23,800 square feet of land from Burlington-Northern/Santa Fe Railroad.  Acquisition of this property will allow the trail to be routed under the Ballard Bridge/Emerson Street interchange, thereby eliminating a major barrier for bicyclists and pedestrians desiring to travel between the Queen Anne and Magnolia communities.

It is part of an important movement corridor for a large elk herd and is used for wintering, spring foraging and calving.  A variety of other wildlife species use the area, including black bear, river otter, coyotes, beaver, small mammals and amphibians.  Resident trout use the creek and marsh channels.One of the two largest populations of the rare pale blue-eyed grass, a federal candidate species, and the largest population of the rare Pulsifers monkey-flower known to occur in Washington State are found here.</div>')[0];
