0,47.13918637-123.05408818,"Forterra proposes to acquire a conservation easement on a property on the southern shore of Little Skookum Inlet in Mason County, consisting of 816 acres of working forests, wetlands, riparian habitat, and nearly two miles of Puget Sound shoreline. The goal is to permanently protect the property from conversion to non-forest uses by placing a CE to extinguish the development rights and expand the existing no-cut buffers (currently 50’-90’, which follows state Forest Practices) to 150' on the salmon-bearing streams and 100' on the marine shoreline, permanently protecting the property’s working forest, environmental, and ecosystem benefits. Preventing development on the property eliminates the possibility of conversion to a non-forest uses, as well as anthropogenic damages to water quality (e.g., fecal coliform contamination, water temperature), salmon habitat, shoreline processes, and cultural resources associated with residential development.The property has been actively-managed as a working forest for over 150 years by Port Blakely Tree Farms, generating multiple rotations of timber and supplying local mills. However, the property has been zoned for rural residential development, and plans drawn up for its development. Conversion to a non-forest use would not only impact generations of local forest products, habitat, and cultural resources, but it would also be detrimental to the productive - and commercially lucrative - shellfish growing areas in the inlet.
